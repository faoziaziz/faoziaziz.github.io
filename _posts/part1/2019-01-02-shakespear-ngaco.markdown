I don't know how to start to learn to write in English. I just know that every day
I read a book in English. On my mind, I often think that I must have English skill
in clear, but Every day I read an English book, maybe I never to contemplate
what I read in structural grammar. Today, I download a book which title is
English Grammar which is published by Oxford University Press. I know that
only read the theory I never get good English.

Is English enough? I don't think so but on my experience, I have learned Marx, Nietzsche, Sartre, Kierkegaard, which translates to English. I had many books which written in English, and I read every day, maybe there are 700's books I have been read in last year.

And why I titled this post "Shakespeare Ngaco", I have been signed up in interpals to find penpals that I hope I get new friends who can help me to write in English. And suddenly I found an account that she blocked all Indonesian and Turkey account, she wrote that she feel annoyed because Indonesian and Turkey people call her beautiful and cute. She also quotes Shakespeare.
